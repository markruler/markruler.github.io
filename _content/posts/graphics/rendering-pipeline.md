렌더링 파이프라인이란

# Concept

1. Application Stage — This stage is where the CPU processes transformations and user inputs and prepares data for the GPU.
2. Geometry Processing — Handles per-vertex operations, projection, and clipping on the GPU.
3. Rasterization 📊 — Converts 3D geometry into pixels based on lighting, textures, and object positions.
4. Pixel Processing ✨ — Applies final effects like anti-aliasing, motion blur, and depth of field for visual refinement.
